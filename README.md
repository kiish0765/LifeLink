# LifeLink
LifeLink is a full-stack blood bank management system I developed to bridge the gap between donors and hospitals in real time. Built with React 18, Node.js, and TypeScript, it uses a triple-database architecture (Postgres, MongoDB, Redis) and WebSockets to reduce emergency response times through smart donor matching and instant alerts.
